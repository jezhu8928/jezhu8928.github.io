#### my personal website

A website I put together at the start of 1B to showcase my past work experiences, and show off some personality. I did make a website for the start of 1A
but I felt like using ReactJS and Gatsby was overkill for what I'd be using the site for. So, this time around, I made the most basic site with HTML/CSS, 
and a sparing amount of JS. I also made an attempt at designing the layout myself, and I think it turned out okay. As the terms pass, I'll try to keep it up
to date, so keep checking back to see what I've been up to B-).
