#### *my personal website*

A website I put together at the start of 1B to showcase my past work experience, and show off some personality. I also made a website for the start of 1A, with React and Gatsby, but I felt like that tech stack was overkill for the purpose of the site. So, this time around, I made the most basic site with HTML/CSS, and a sparing amount of JS. I also made an attempt at designing the layout myself, and I think it turned out okay. As the terms pass, I'll try to keep it up to date, so check back to see what I've been up to ðŸ˜Ž
